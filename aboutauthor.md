# About the author

Brian Munson is a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Brown
University. He was a NSF postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and
Associate Professor of Mathematics at the U.S. Naval Academy. He has published
numerous research articles in topology and coauthored a text on homotopy theory.

Brian is an expert on topological data analysis. He seeks to drive innovation in
data mining through the application of these methods, and to help better integrate
them with existing machine learning techniques. His goal is the creation of an analytics
pipeline that uses topological methods to better inform feature extraction and model
selection, improving the quality and speed of insights to create more robust actionables.
Brian is interested in a wide variety of problems, from biological, to social, financial, and
beyond, and relishes the challenge of finding more subtle insight from data.
